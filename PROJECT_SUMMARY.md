# AstroAgent: Project Summary

AstroAgent is a full-stack astronomy application that combines high-precision ephemeris calculations (FastAPI backend with Skyfield/DE440S) with an interactive 3D visualization (Next.js/Three.js frontend) and a voice-enabled AI assistant. The AI agent uses OpenAI's Realtime API with WebRTC for bidirectional voice communication, and is equipped with 5 specialized tools that fetch astronomical data from the backend (planet positions, observation quality metrics, future viewing windows) and control the 3D camera. The system architecture separates concerns cleanly: the backend handles all astronomical computations using JPL's DE440S ephemeris data, the frontend manages 3D rendering and UI state, and the AI agent orchestrates tool calls and generates natural language responses. Key design optimizations include 1-hour position caching with interpolation (reducing API calls by ~95%), debounced observation planning requests, and context-aware agent initialization that provides immediate observing conditions. The agent intelligently coordinates multiple tools (e.g., when asked "Where is Saturn?", it calls position, observation plan, and camera control tools simultaneously) to provide comprehensive responses while triggering visual feedback in the 3D scene.
