# AstroAgent: Snacks for Stargazers

Welcome to the app that points your digital telescope so you can pretend you meant to look there all along.

- Ask, “Where’s Jupiter?” and we’ll shout at the camera until it behaves.
- Bask in a green-tinted UI that says “NASA, but make it vibes.”
- Chat with an AI that knows constellations and politely ignores flat-earthers.

### Quick Start
```
git clone astroagent
cd astroagent && npm run everything-probably
```
If that fails, try the README you deleted to read this.

### Pro Tips
- Works best at night. Shocking, we know.
- Don’t cross the streams (frontend on :3000, backend on :8000).
- Bring snacks; astronomy is 90% waiting for clouds to leave.

Happy star surfing! ⭐️
